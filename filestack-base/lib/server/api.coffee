      #   * The relevant task document might have been removed from the db already, and we just need to
      #   clean associated resources (such as remove converted files from filestack).
      #   * Save another call to the db to fetch it, in case we got it already.
      #
      # If provided, we:
      # 
      #   1. Will remove the file reference from the provided task's .files array.
      #   2. Will look for stored converted files of the provided file, if found:
      #     2.1 We will assume that the file also have data about its dimension stored, and will remove it
      #         from the db as well (if task hasn't been removed altogether).
      #         The file dimension is stored under: cleanup_from_task_document._secret.files_dimensions[file.id]
      #     2.2 We will remove converted files stored for file from filestack, and (if task hasn't been
      #         removed altogether), we will update the db accordingly.
      #         References to the converted files are under: 
      #           cleanup_from_task_document._secret.files_previews[file.id] # (file is the file

      # As mentioned above, by the time cleanupRemovedFile() with cleanup_from_task_document, the task might
      # had been removed from the db, our cleanups in such case are mostly critical to remove associated
      # information stored outside of the db.

Custom Fields Setup
===================

Custom fields must be enabled on both the server and the client in order to be used.

That is done by calling the GridControlCustomFields.enableJustdoCustomFieldsForJustdoProject()
from both the server and client.

An exapmle can be found on package: justdo-projects/lib/both/main.coffee

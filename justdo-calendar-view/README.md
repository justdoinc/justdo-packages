Added a end_date field to the grid with this plugin. Intentionally didn't 
make it plugin specific as I believe that this field is needed anyway, and will be 
reused in other places. -AL

workdays and holidays are based on  the justdo_delivery_planner.justdo_level_workdays,
with internal default if that module is not set.

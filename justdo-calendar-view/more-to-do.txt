Things to do:
+ remove the unassigned line
+ remove the one day backward/forward options
+ refactor prev and next week functons to prevent duplicates
+ add an area to scroll left/right
+ bug when due date is before start date something doesn't work
+ followup should be presented only with the owner. Now it's listed also with resources members
+ issue with dragging followup to a different user
+ bug dropping regular task not working
+ dropping regular task - move the end-date
+ calendar should be a rolling one
+ move tasks dates.
+ work with start date and a new field - end date (not due-date).
+ identify non-working days, holidays,
+ when moving a start date on the calendar - deal with non-working days
+ calendar view should start always with the first day of the week.
+ have a visual hint on the task for the state
+ dayte's names (monday tuesday...)

- alerts - use Opher's method.


- project filtering on the calendar

- unassigned hours should be part of the task's owner view
- moving unassigned hours to a new user- should also reassign the task

- moving hours from one user to another changes ownership (can't move just hours, if need to move just
  hours - use the resource planner view)
- a way to view all unassigned hours

- identify vacation days of users
- handle a case what we move a task to a member that is not a member of this task

- set justdo's level workdays and people's working hours etc. - igor to design

- configuration - work with planned hours . working with left hours will happen later...

later:
- change task duration with drag and drop
- a visual hint for people that are not on the selected task
- there is a bug (minute 26) on the project plugin that not all tasks members are listed (task 29)
- drag and drop from the main table to the calendar




- planned work
  + present on calendar view
  - present the unassigned work user
  - allow to change from one person to the other
  - write an algo that checks if there are enough hours to complete all tasks , present on each day, how many hours are
    allocated to which task.



- start end
  - allow changing duration
  - use Ofer's method to display load


+ dimm cases where there is a pending owner
+ highlight the entire cell
+ scroll one day at a time
+ change start day to start of week (based on user preference)
+ the project pane is not scrollable (sides and up-down)
+ handle private f/u
+ table doesn't display onthe first column
+ drag to change owner
+ display the task based on the pending owner ID, not the existing one.
+ handle start-end
+ query only the fields I care about (to reduce overhead)

on hold:
- hover on something to scroll one day - will not do, as requires timers etc.
- make the project pane scrollabel just at the table level (not the entire thing) (need help here)


Additions for resource management
+ additional field of 'unassigned work' will be added at the task level. will hold
  seconds and be presented in hours/days
+ when increasing planned hours, a server side hook will deduct the time added from the unassigned
  time (down to zero unassigned)
+ need to add a caching for the amount of work (planned and executed) per member on the task level
  (today we only have the total (will be done with the server-side hook)

Things to do:

- planned work
  + present on calendar view
  - present the unassigned work user
  - allow to change from one person to the other
  - write an algo that checks if there are enough hours to complete all tasks , present on each day, how many hours are
    allocated to which task.



- start end
  - allow changing duration
  - use Ofer's method to display load


+ dimm cases where there is a pending owner
+ highlight the entire cell
+ scroll one day at a time
+ change start day to start of week (based on user preference)
+ the project pane is not scrollable (sides and up-down)
+ handle private f/u
+ table doesn't display onthe first column
+ drag to change owner
+ display the task based on the pending owner ID, not the existing one.
+ handle start-end
+ query only the fields I care about (to reduce overhead)

on hold:
- hover on something to scroll one day - will not do, as requires timers etc.
- make the project pane scrollabel just at the table level (not the entire thing) (need help here)


Additions for resource management
+ additional field of 'unassigned work' will be added at the task level. will hold
  seconds and be presented in hours/days
+ when increasing planned hours, a server side hook will deduct the time added from the unassigned
  time (down to zero unassigned)
+ need to add a caching for the amount of work (planned and executed) per member on the task level
  (today we only have the total (will be done with the server-side hook)

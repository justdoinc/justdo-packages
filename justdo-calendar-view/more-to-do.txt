Things to do:
- handle start-end
- highlight the entire cell
- scroll one day at a time
- hover on something to scroll one day
- change start day to start of week (based on user preference)
- start end
  - allow changing duration
  - use Ofer's method to display load

- make the project pane scrollabel just at the table level (not the entire thing)
+ the project pane is not scrollable (sides and up-down)
+ handle private f/u
+ table doesn't display onthe first column
+ drag to change owner
+ display the task based on the pending owner ID, not the existing one.

Additions for resource management
- additional field of 'unassigned work' will be added at the task level. will hold
  seconds and be presented in hours/days
- when increasing planned hours, a server side hook will deduct the time added from the unassigned
  time (down to zero unassigned)
- need to add a caching for the amount of work (planned and executed) per member on the task level
  (today we only have the total (will be done with the server-side hook)

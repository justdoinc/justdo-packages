### Todo:
* requires calendar (for the end-date)
* requires dependencies 
* there is an issue when a task has a start, end and a due date.
  Need to add two objects to the gantt (at the moment I just add
  the due-date as a milestone )
* set a different color scale for things that are 'done' 

### need Daniel's help with:
* scroll on the gantt chart
* auto refresh on resize of the window.
* refresh on changes to tasks (adding/removeing tasks, changind dates, etc.)

      decision to invoke this binding arbitration option is entirely voluntary. However, any arbitral decisions will
      be binding on all parties to the arbitration. Once invoked, the individual forgoes the option to seek relief for
      the same claimed violation in another forum, except that if non-monetary equitable relief does not fully remedy
      the claimed violation, the individual’s invocation of arbitration will not preclude a claim for damages that is
      otherwise available in the courts. To initiate arbitration please contact the American Arbitration Association.
        Each side will be responsible for its own costs.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Introduction.</strong><br>

      <strong>Definitions.</strong>
      <ol>
        <li><u>A User</u> - is an individual who has registered and uses JustDo.</li>
        <li><u>A Task</u> - for convenience sake we name action items, service tickets, clients lists, features requests or others - in the context of JustDo and this document - Tasks.</li>
        <li><u>A Task Update</u> - an operation that updated the information associated with the Task. This could be an update to the status of the Task, a new chat message, an update to other fields of the Task record, etc.</li>
        <li><u>Users Collaboration - </u>
          <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">Users Collaboration is measured and recorded on a daily basis at 00:00 GMT</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">At the recording time, an automated script cycle through all the Tasks in the system. For each of those Tasks, it finds how many Users performed a Task Update for that Task within the last 7 days. If it finds two or more such Users, it records that those Users collaborated on the Task.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><u>A JustDo</u> - is a list of Tasks grouped together within JustDo’s services.</li>
        <li>
          <p><u>A Cluster</u> - A Cluster is a list of Users who Collaborated with each other within a group of Tasks within a JustDo.</p>
          <p>
            <i>For example, for a JustDo with tasks Task1, Task2, Task3, and Task4,  where the following Collaboration took place:<br>
               - on Task1 User1 collaborated with User2 and User3<br>
               - on Task2 User1 collaborated with User4<br>
               - on Task3 User2 collaborated with User5<br>
               - on Task4 User6 collaborated with User7<br>
               We get two clusters, one with Users1,2,3,4 & 5 and one with Users6 and 7.<br>
               <p><i>This can be easily visualized in the following form:</i></p>
               <img class="my-2" src="/layout/promoters/clusters.png" alt="clusters">

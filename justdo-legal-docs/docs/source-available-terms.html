      <h1 class="title">Trademark Policy</h1>
      <div>
        <p>This document specifically addresses the trademark aspects of JustDo and should not be construed as a software license or permission for free deployment of the JustDo software. The licensing terms for using, modifying, creating derivative works, or distributing the JustDo software are covered in a separate license agreement. This trademark policy focuses solely on the use of JustDo's name, logo, and other brand elements.</p>
        <p>JustDo Inc. owns and oversees the trademarks for the name JustDo. Trademarks serve as signifiers of a product's identity and reputation. In a Source Available project, where the code and all 'traditional' intellectual property are accessible and available for deployment by third parties, the use of official logos and marks becomes particularly significant. We consider the application of these marks to be a matter of great importance, and we aim to protect their value to maintain the integrity of the JustDo community. The trademark usage policy has been developed with the following goals in mind:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Our aim is to provide clear guidelines on how JustDo-related businesses and projects may and may not use the JustDo name and logo.</li>
          <li>We strive to prevent the misuse of the JustDo name and logo by those who might attempt to unfairly profit from, deceive, or confuse individuals seeking official JustDo resources.</li>
          <li>We aim to ensure that the JustDo name and logo is associated only with code that has passed our rigorous quality control and security measures.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="subtitle">JustDo Inc. Trademark Usage Policy</div>
        <p>Permission from JustDo Inc. is required to use the JustDo name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain name, or company name.</p>
        <p>Businesses or projects related to JustDo may use the JustDo name and logo to refer to and explain their services. However, they may not incorporate these elements into a product, project, service, domain name, or company name. Furthermore, they must not use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by JustDo Inc.</p>
        <p>For example, a consulting company may describe its business as "XYZ Development Services, offering JustDo consulting for businesses," but it cannot name its business "The JustDo Consulting Company." Similarly, a business related to JustDo plugins may describe itself as "XYZ Plugins, offering top-quality JustDo plugins," but it cannot call itself "The JustDo Plugins Portal."</p>
        <p>It is acceptable to use the JustDo logo on a page that describes your products or services. However, it is not permissible to incorporate it into your company or product logo or branding. Under no circumstances is it allowed to use JustDo as part of a domain name or top-level domain name. For instance, domain names such as "justdo-place.com" or "justdo.xyz.com" are prohibited.</p>
        <p>We do not permit the use of the JustDo trademark in advertising, including but not limited to AdSense and AdWords campaigns.</p>

        <div class="subtitle">Deploying JustDo Source Available Code</div>
        <p>You may deploy the JustDo Source Available code without altering the logo or the name "JustDo" in its original locations, provided that you adhere to the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You clearly indicate that your project is not affiliated with the official JustDo project.</li>
          <li>You have not modified the code in any way.</li>
          <li>You commit to maintaining the code by regularly updating it to the latest version of the JustDo project, ensuring that all security vulnerabilities are patched.</li>
          <li>You prevent search engine indexing of the JustDo project. (Note: An environment variable is available to disable indexing and is enabled by default.)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="subtitle">Derivative Works and Forks</div>
        <p>When creating a derivative work, fork, or any modified version based on the JustDo project, you are prohibited from using the JustDo name, logo, or any variations or combinations thereof without explicit written permission from JustDo Inc. This prohibition extends to, but is not limited to, names such as EnhancedJustDo, JustDo+, JustDoNG, JustDo2.0, or any other name that incorporates 'JustDo' or could be easily confused with the JustDo brand. Your derivative work must be clearly distinguished from the original JustDo project in both name and branding.</p>

    JustDo's Resource Management is a complementary plugin that lets you:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimate the labor and budget required when planning a project.  Map the time that each team member needs to contribute in order to complete any specific task.  See how it accumulates over different tasks and see the consolidated data in the projectâ€™s parent task.</li>
      <li>Know how many hours and how much money was actually spent on any given project or task. Team members can easily log the time and money spent on a task whilst they are working on it. This information is collected, aggregated, and presented in a way that shows the total and breakdown of the hours and money spent. You can see your team members individual and overall contributions.</li>
      <li>Know how close you are to completing any project or task. Once you know how many hours are needed to accomplish your goals and how many hours were already spent, you can estimate how much of the project has been completed and how much more is left to do.</li>
      <li>Update and fine-tune your plans over time. As you understand the project better and adjust the resource estimation to accommodate real-life demands, changes, updates and other events, you can update the amounts planned for every task. The system will immediately reflect those changes and will show how they affect the amounts left to do in order to complete the project.</li>
    </ul>

    A Guest works like a standard, non-Admin member. The only difference from a standard JustDo member is that rather than the complete JustDo members' list, Guests can only see and interact with members of the tasks that are shared with them.

    NOTE: All past activities of tasks shared with a Guest, will be visible to the Guest.

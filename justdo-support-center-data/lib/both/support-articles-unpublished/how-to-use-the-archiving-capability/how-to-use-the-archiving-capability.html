  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are new projects and new activities you need to work on, you need to put the old ones aside and focus on the new ones. In JustDo you can archive projects as well as any basket task and its sub-tree.</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Archiving a sub-tree</strong></span></p>
  <p>In order to archive a sub-tree click right button on the selected task and select "Archive". Once archived, you will noticed that the task itself shows up in gray with an archived icon and all its sub-tree doesn't show up.</p>
  <p>If the archive task was a project, it will automatically be closed (and the project icon will turn gray).</p>

  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Viewing an archived sub-tree</strong></span></p>
  <p>Even if a sub-tree is archived, you can still view it if needed. Simply select "zoom in" from the context menu.</p>
  <p>Please note: although archived, the tasks are still active and can be updated.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Unarchiving a sub-tree </strong></span></p>
  <p>Any archived task can be unarchived by selecting the "Unarchive" option from the context menu.</p>
  <p>Reopening an archived project will mark it as open and unarchive it as well.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Multiple parents scenarios</strong></span></p>
  <p>A task that has multiple parents can be archived, and it will show up as archived under all its parents.</p>
  <p>A task that has multiple parents and one of its parents was archived will be archived ONLY with the sub-tree that was archived. Under all other parents it will still show up as before. </p>

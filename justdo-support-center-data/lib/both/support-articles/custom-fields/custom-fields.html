  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom fields give you the option to track, monitor and control project-specific information, such as specific work-flow stages, options lists, textual information, dates, etc.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Custom Fields are used in conjunction with filters, a new and powerful way to look at project’s information emerges as described below.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Admins can create and maintain the custom fields, and this is done using the "Configure this JustDo" option under the settings icon.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/custom-fields/assets/configure.jpg" alt="configure.jpg" width="306" height="240"></span></p>
  <p>JustDo supports the following field types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text - Textual columns allow users to list specific notes, references, links, and can be used among other things to list client’s name and contact information, list a case number in CRM environment, part number in production floor environment, a commit ID in software development projects etc.</span></li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number - Numeric columns allow users to enter any numeric value. </span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date - Dates columns allow users to log specific dates such as delivery to the client, date of transfer to another department, next report date, audit date, etc. </span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Options - These fields allow users to define a list of predetermined values from which the user can select a single value per task. For each option the admin can select a color that will show up when this value is selected. Option lists can include geographical locations, demographics, machinery stations, departments, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another useful way to use custom options is for a work-flow progress with values set to various stages of the workflow such as “draft”, “revision”, “confirmation”, “approval”, etc. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> third example could be in order fulfillment process with a list that contains “order placed,” “waiting for shipping,” “shipped,” “delivered.”<br></span>After creating the custom option field, click the edit icon to define the list of values.</p>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi options - Same as "Options" field with one difference: the user can select multiple options per each task.</span></li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart numbers - In addition for this being a text field, it can also contain one of fixed numeric formulas that will calculate the value based on the numeric values of its sub tasks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For example this field can include the cost of each task and at the project level show the accumulated cost. <br>In order to define the formula one would need to select the appropriate value from the task context menu (clicking right button in the required cell), and selecting the required action.<br><br><img src="/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/custom-fields/assets/smart_numbers_menu.jpg" alt="smart_numbers_menu.jpg" width="301" height="132"><br></span>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formula (only when "Formulas" extension is enabled) - allow users to calculate a value based on other numeric values of the same task. Supported operators are: +,-, *,/,(,) and the functions: abs, ceil, fix, floor, mod, round, sign, max, mean, median, min.<br>After creating the new formula field, click the edit icon to define the formula itself.</span></li>
  </ul>

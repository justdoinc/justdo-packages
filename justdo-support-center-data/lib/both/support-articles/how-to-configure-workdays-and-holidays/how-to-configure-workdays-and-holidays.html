<template name="support_article_how_to_configure_workdays_and_holidays">
  <p>The option to configure the workdays of the week is added when an Admin enables the Calendar extension using the "Configure this JustDo" option under the settings button. </p>
  <p>Once added, any Admin can configure the workdays, work hours and holidays for the entire JustDo and for specific users, while any member or guest can configure their own.</p>
  <p>Configuring this for the entire JustDo is done by clicking the "Set Workdays" option under the setting button:</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/how-to-configure-workdays-and-holidays/assets/JD_workdays.GIF"}}" alt="JD_workdays.GIF" width="553" height="407"></p>
  <p>Please note that configuring workdays and hours for the entire JustDo is also enabled when the Gantt extension is turned on.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You can define different workdays, work hours and additional holidays for specific users in the Calendar view by clicking the clock icon on the user's name:</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/how-to-configure-workdays-and-holidays/assets/user_workdays.GIF"}}" alt="user_workdays.GIF" width="553" height="340"></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In both options, dates can be entered as discrete dates or as a range of dates. If a range is entered it will converted to a list of discrete dates by the platform.  </p>
  <p>A valid sequence for example is:</p>
  <p>2022-09-01, 2022-09-25--2022-09-27, 2022-10-04--2022-10-05, 2022-10-09</p>
  <p><strong>Status indicator indications</strong></p>
  <p>When a period of time includes a company wide holiday vacation, or a personal time off for the owner of the task - it may impact the delivery dates. Therefore, JustDo lets you know if this is the case using the status indicator column. If there is a company wide vacation between the task's start date and end date, the value "Holiday" will show up. If this period include a personal time off of the owner of the task, the value "Leave" would show up.</p>

  <p>Admins can configure workdays, work hours, and holidays in JustDo after enabling the Calendar extension via "Configure this JustDo" under the settings button.</p>
  <p>Admins can configure these settings for the entire JustDo platform or specific users, while members and guests can configure their own settings.</p>
  <p>To configure for the entire JustDo, click "Set Workdays" under the settings button:</p>
  <p><img src="{{getSupportCenterAssetUrl "/how-to-configure-workdays-and-holidays/assets/JD_workdays.GIF"}}" alt="JD_workdays.GIF" width="553" height="407"></p>
  <p>Note: Configuring workdays and hours for the entire JustDo is also enabled when the Gantt extension is turned on.</p>
  <p>You can define different workdays, work hours, and additional holidays for specific users in the Calendar view by clicking the clock icon on the user's name:</p>
  <p><img src="{{getSupportCenterAssetUrl "/how-to-configure-workdays-and-holidays/assets/user_workdays.GIF"}}" alt="user_workdays.GIF" width="553" height="340"></p>
  <p>In both options, you can enter dates as discrete dates or as a range of dates. Ranges will be converted to a list of discrete dates by the platform.</p>
  <p><strong>Example of a valid date sequence:</strong></p>
  <p>2022-09-01, 2022-09-25--2022-09-27, 2022-10-04--2022-10-05, 2022-10-09</p>
  <p><strong>Status Indicator:</strong></p>
  <p>The status indicator column shows if a task's delivery date might be impacted by company-wide holidays or personal time off. "Holiday" indicates a company-wide holiday within the task's duration, and "Leave" indicates personal time off for the task owner within the task's duration.</p>

  <p>In JustDo you can customize the grid view easily by adding columns, removing columns, setting their width, reordering them and apply filters.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>JustDo provides you with a set of views that you can simply switch between using the "switch view" button at the top left of your screen.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>You can also maintain a list of views that you created and switch between these easily using the "Grid views" button.</p>
  <p>These views exist in the context of the specific JustDo.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Applying a view</strong></p>
  <p>Click the desired view name in the list of views, and the grid view will change to the selected view.</p>
  <p>You can apply any saved view to any of the system views, no matter where it was saved. For example, a view that was saved in a zoom-in mode can be applied to the entire grid (in main view mode)</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Saving a view</strong></p>
  <p>In the grid view, add or remove columns, set their width and order and even apply filters as you desire.</p>
  <p>Once the grid view is in its desired form, click the "grid views" icon, click "Add current view"  button and provide it with a name (a default name will be provided otherwise).</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Updating a view</strong></p>
  <p>The user who created the view can rename it, using the "Rename" option of the 3 dots menu.</p>
  <p>At any point in time this user can also update the view to reflect the current grid view. </p>
  <p>Please note that once update, the updated view overrides the previous view. If this was done unintentionally, you can use the "undo" option presented for a few seconds in the snack-bar.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Removing a view</strong></p>
  <p>The user who saved the view can always choose to remove it from the view list.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Sharing a view with others</strong></p>
  <p>Admins can create views and publish them for all other users to see and use. Only the admin who created the view can share it and any subsequent change to the view, automatically changes for all users.</p>

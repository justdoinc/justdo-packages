  <p>You can easily define that new tasks will be created by email, this is great when you want to allow people from outside of the company, on even employees who do not have access to your JustDo create tasks and action items. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All you need to do, is turn on the option "Spawn Tasks" in the "EMAILS" tab of the task pane.</p>
  <p>Once this option is turned on, any email sent to the task email address will open a new child task under it with the email subject as the task subject and the appropriate email saved in its "EMAILS" tab.<br>The owner of the new task would be the owner of the parent task.</p>
  <p>To allow tracking, if the sender of the email is a member of the JustDo, the task would be created as them being the owner and automatically transfer the ownership to the owner of the parent task.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Please note that the emails extension must be turned on. Any Admin can turn it on by clicking the "Configure this JustDo" option under the settings button and selecting it in the "Extensions" tab.</p>

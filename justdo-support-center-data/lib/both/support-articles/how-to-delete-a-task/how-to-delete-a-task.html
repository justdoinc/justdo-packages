  <p>In order to delete a task:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select the task you want to delete</li>
    <li>Click on the trashcan icon to delete the task</li>
    <li>Confirm the operation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please note that a task that has sub-tasks (even if they are not displayed due to filter setup or access right issues) can not be removed from the system. In such case, remove the sub-tasks before you try to delete this task.</p>
  <p>Also note that we recommend to delete a task only if it was added by mistake. If the task is completed, we recommend changing the task state to 'done' and using the state filter to hide it. This way, the information associated with the task is still available in the system for retrieval in the future, and at the same time it does not overload the tasks list. </p>

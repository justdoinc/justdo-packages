        <p>If you already have tasks in another platform you do not need to create them from scratch. You can easily import the task structure from a spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Once the JustDo Admin enables the "Spreadsheet Import" extension, the spreadsheet import button will show up on the top toolbar.</p>

        <p> In order to import from a spreadsheet follow the steps below:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Select a task in the grid that the imported tasks will be added under</li>
        <li>Copy the relevant section from an Excel spreadsheet (maximum of 500 rows for one import action)</li>
        <li>Click the Spreadsheet Import icon </li>
        <li>Paste in the window that is opened</li>
        <li>If there are rows that you do not want to import - uncheck them</li>
        <li>For each and every column, click the column header (labeled "Select") and select one of the five options:<ul>
        <li>Skip column - if this column should not be imported.</li>
        <li>Mark the column as an index column - for dependency import (see below)</li>
        <li>Select a target JustDo field for the values of that column (you can search for the field by its name using the search option).<br>The list includes system fields as well as any custom fields of types: text, number, date or options </li>
        <li>Manage columns - for Admins only - you can add a custom field if needed. </li>
        <li>Indent level - select for a column that marks the level on indentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click "Import"</li>
    <li>Select the date format of the imported data from the drop-down (for origin data that contain time as well only the date will be extracted)</li>
    <li>Click "Ok"</li>
  </ol>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Dependency import </strong>- if your data has dependencies between the tasks, it usually use an index column for the ids of the tasks. Once you mark that column as "Index", the dependencies will be imported and updated to the appropriate JustDo ids. The index column will not be imported. If the dependency column contains a value that is not supported by JustDo, it will be imported into the predecessor column, yet will be ignored and colored in red.</p>
  <p>Different types of dependencies are supported, Finish-to-Start (FS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), Start-to-Start (SS), and Start-to-Finish (SF). In order to import those dependencies make sure you are using the task ID followed by the relevant acronyms FF/SS/SF/FS. If no letters are added, the default dependency type is assumed - Finish-to-Start.</p>

  <p><strong>State import</strong></p>
  <p>Please note that you can import the values for the state field. If the value was empty or no value was imported, the task will be opened with Pending state.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Owner import</strong></p>
  <p>You can import the owner of task by including the owner's email address in the column. The imported tasks will be owned by the imported owner with <span class="wysiwyg-underline">no need to accept ownership transfer.</span></p>
  <p>If the owner's email doesn't exist as a member of the JustDo, an alert icon will show up and if imported like that, the owner of that task will be the user who is performing the import.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Import Undo</strong></p>
  <p>Once the import is completed a snackbar will show up at the bottom left of the screen. Clicking the "Undo" option will undo all import results.</p>
  <p>You can click the X for the snackbar to disappear.</p>

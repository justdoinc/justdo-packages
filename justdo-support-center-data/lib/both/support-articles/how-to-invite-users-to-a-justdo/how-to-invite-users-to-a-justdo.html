  <p>Users will show up in one of three sections:</p>
  <p><strong>New users</strong> - users that are not registered in this JustDo installation, for these users you would have to enter their first and last names.</p>
  <p><strong>Existing users</strong> - users that are already registered to another JustDo in this installation, they will be added to this JustDo as well. Their role will be as you indicate here.</p>
  <p><strong>Existing users of this JustDo</strong> - these users are already users of this JustDo, therefore they will not be added to this JustDo yet they will be added as members to the tasks selected in the next screen.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Adding members to tasks </strong></span></p>
  <p>Once you click "Next" you will be able to add all the users as members to one or more tasks. </p>
  <p>Potential tasks are listed in two groups: Root tasks and projects (a project which is also a root task will appear in both), and you can select one or more.</p>
  <p>Clicking "invite" will add all users to the JustDo and as members to all selected tasks.</p>

  <p>Planning of the work hours of any project or complex task and track the actual investment over time is crucial and essential to businesses for more than just payroll. It is important in order to evaluate your efficiency and quality of time estimates, track your progress against your plan and commitment to management or clients and more.</p>
  <p>There are 2 extensions of JustDo that help you with this process:</p>
  <p><strong>Resource management</strong> - allows you to enter your planed hours per task or group of tasks and track their consumption over time.</p>
  <p><strong>Time Tracker</strong> -  provides an additional layer, by which any employee can report actual dates and times of working on a specific task.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resource Management</strong></span></p>
  <p>For each and every task at any level you can assign planned hours and report executed hours against this number. These can be viewed at the task level as well as accumulated at any level above it.</p>
  <p>Hours can be assigned to a specific person or as unassigned. This is extremely important when you first plan the project time allocations and you do not know yet who will actually do the work. </p>
  <p>Hours can be allocated to anyone who is a member of the task, not only for the owner. </p>
  <p>When allocating hours for a specific person</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you already have unassigned hours planned, the system will ask you if these hours should be taken from the assigned bucket.</li>
    <li>If that person already has hours allocated at one of the parent tasks, the system will ask you if these are additional hours or should these be deducted from the upper level.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>
  <p>In the same manner you can report executed hours - simply select the executed tab and reports number of hours (no specific date and time) per employee</p>
  <p>In the "Left" tab you would be able to see how many you still have left from the plan (i.e., planned hours minus the already invested hours) and in the "Summary" tab you would see the overall summary.</p>
  <p>The "History" tab shows a log of all changed done to the planned and executed hours.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>All planned and executed hours show up in the "Resource management" tab and you could add these columns to the grid view as well.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Time tracker</strong></span></p>
  <p>Executed hours that are reported using the "Resource management" tab are without the specific dates and times in which these were invested. If you are in need for a more detailed reporting of hours invested, the Time Tracker is the perfect extension.</p>
  <p>When enabled each employee can report the actual hours invested in each task, either by clicking the "play" (and then "stop") buttons showing on the task subject in the grid or by manually entering the time reports in the time tracker tab at the bottom pane.</p>
  <p>An admin can report hours for another employee as well.</p>
  <p>These reports add to the executed hours of the resource management tab and can be also viewed in the "history" tab of it. </p>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Time Tracker Reports are easily generated, you can filter by a task or group of tasks, projects, people and time frame. Reports can be generated by clicking the clock icon in the Time Tracker tab or by selecting the Time Tracker option under the printer icon on the top bar.</p>

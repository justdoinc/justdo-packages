<template name="support_article_how_to_print_and_export">
  <p>All stakeholders who are part of the JustDo can view and manage all the projects in JustDo.</p>
  <p>However, sometimes you would need to print or export the data in order to present it to others, or manipulate it further in Excel, upload it to an external platform etc.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In JustDo, all these options are available when clicking the printer icon on the topbar.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Print JustDo </strong></p>
  <p>Print/export tasks of the current view.</p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Entire JustDo</span> - will print/export all the tasks of this view, disregarding filters and expand/collapse selections that are currently active.</p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Visible Tasks</span> - will print/export only the tasks that are shown in the view - taking into account any filters you have active, and including only tasks that are visible on screen based on the collapse/expand settings. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Print current task</strong></p>
  <p>The menu options for the current task appear only when there is a task selected.</p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">All Child Tasks</span> - will print/export the selected task and all of its  child tasks, disregarding filters and expand/collapse selections that are currently active.</p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Visible Child Tasks</span> - will print/export the selected task and only the tasks that are shown on screen - taking into account any filters you have active, and including only tasks that are visible on screen based on the collapse/expand settings. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Download as PNG</strong></p>
  <p>The first 4 options described above are for printing and exporting the data without the graphics, if you would like to include the graphics, please use the "Download as PNG" option.</p>
  <p>Please note that the entire grid (exactly as it appears on screen) is included in a single PNG without splitting it into pages. This is done so you could crop and split the image in anyway you want it to be, having full control on how the data is presented.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>JustDo time tracker</strong></p>
  <p>This option is only available when the time tracker extension in turned on.</p>
  <p>For more details please refer to <a href="{{i18nPath "/support/how-to-plan-and-track-working-hours"}}" target="_blank">How to Plan and Track working hours?</a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Print and export options in the preview</strong></p>
  <p>Once you use one of the options under "Print JustDo" or "Print Current task", a preview of the data that will be printed/exported will show on screen, with a toolbar of options at the bottom of the screen.</p>

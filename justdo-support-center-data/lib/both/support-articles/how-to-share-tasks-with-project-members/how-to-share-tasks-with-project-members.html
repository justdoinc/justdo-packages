  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to collaborate and share Tasks’ information with other JustDo members, those Tasks should be explicitly shared. This is also the reason why when you invite a new member to a JustDo, she will see a JustDo with no tasks (see below) until Tasks are shared with her.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to share tasks with JustDo members follow the steps below:</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Select the task you want to share</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Open the “Edit task members” pane, either from the Details tab of the Task Pane or from the link at the bottom of the Transfer ownership dialog </span></li>

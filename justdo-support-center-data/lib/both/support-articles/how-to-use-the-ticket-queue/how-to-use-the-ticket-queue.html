  <p>When you need an easy and fast way for the JustDo members to create tasks of a certain nature and simply send these to the appropriate team to handle the Ticket Queue is the perfect solution for you.</p>
  <p>Any JustDo member can click the <a href="{{i18nPath "/support/what-is-the-quick-add-button"}}" target="_blank">Quick Add button</a> select the appropriate Ticket Queue and fill out a form that will create a task for the queue owner.   <br><br></p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Any task can be set as a Ticket Queue. An Admin defines a task as a Ticket Queue using the "Configure this JustDo" option under the settings button. </p>
  <p>Unsetting a task as a Ticket Queue is done in the same place. Unsetting a task as a Ticket Queue  removes it from the "Ticket Queues" menu at the bottom of the task tree, yet it doesn't delete the task nor its child tasks.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>It is recommended to combine a Ticket Queue with the option of <a href="{{i18nPath "/support/how-to-create-tasks-by-email"}}" target="_blank">Spawn Tasks</a> to enable opening of tickets using emails. This is especially true when you want to allow people that are not part of the JustDo to create tickets, for example opening a support ticket by your customers. </p>

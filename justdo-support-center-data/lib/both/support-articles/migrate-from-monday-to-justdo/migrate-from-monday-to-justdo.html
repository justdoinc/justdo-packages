    <p class="intro">
      Ready to transition from Monday.com to JustDo? This guide shows how your Monday.com data and access controls map cleanly to JustDo's enterprise platform, and how the shift unlocks a clearer, organization-wide view.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With JustDo's multi-level structure, related work lives in one place, so leadership gets a true portfolio picture, teams see cross-functional dependencies, and improvements surface faster.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once you're migrated, that unified view turns into momentum: smarter prioritization, cleaner handoffs, and easier scaling across projects and departments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      JustDo also supports <strong>fully air-gapped deployment</strong>. If you need to isolate critical data and workflows from the public internet, you can run JustDo in an environment you control - on-premises or in a private cloud - with strict network boundaries. This gives you audited access, fine-grained permissions, and the ability to enforce your own security, compliance, and data-retention policies. Further, for full transparency, the source code is available for your audit, and full assurance of business continuity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Understanding the Migration</h2>
    <p>
      JustDo provides a secure, straightforward transition path for enterprise teams. Your organizational structure, project data, and fine-grained access controls translate naturally into JustDo's flexible and powerful system.

    <h3>How Monday.com Maps to JustDo</h3>
    <br>

    <h5>Hierarchy Structure</h5>
    <p>Your Monday.com structure maps to JustDo as follows:</p>

    <table class="mapping-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Monday.com</th>
          <th>JustDo Equivalent</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Workspace</strong></td>
          <td><strong>JustDo Board</strong></td>
          <td>Top-level container</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Folder</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Department/Folder (Projects Collection)</strong></td>
          <td>On Monday these groups related boards together. JustDo's multi-level hierarchy allows it to hold all in a single JustDo board for an easy bird-eye org view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Board</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
          <td>On Monday typically represents a project, a workflow, a client list, etc. On JustDo you see all the projects in one bird-eye view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Group</strong></td>
          <td><strong>State field</strong></td>
          <td>JustDo supports assigning multiple Groups per task - to help accommodate multiple workflows that are affecting the same task in a project<sup>1</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Items</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Tasks</strong></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <img src="/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/migrate-from-monday-to-justdo/assets/monday-justdo-hierarchy.png" alt="Monday.com to JustDo Hierarchy" class="img-fluid">

    <p class="note">
      <sup>1</sup> <strong>Example:</strong> In Monday, a board might use one <strong>Group</strong> for the development lifecycle (e.g., <em>Pending → In Progress → QA → Done</em>). In JustDo, you can keep that <strong>and</strong> add an extra Group track - for example, <em>Invoicing</em>, <em>Announcement Prep</em>, or <em>Documentation</em> - so the same task can move through development <strong>and</strong> business processes in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> Your Monday.com structure of <code>Workspace → Folder → Board → Group → Items</code> becomes <code>JustDo Board → Folder → Board → Project → Tasks</code> in JustDo.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h5>Field Type Mapping</h5>
    <p>
      JustDo maintains compatibility with Monday's fields.

    <h2>Migrating Users and Access Control</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most critical aspects of enterprise migration is preserving your access control and permission structures. JustDo offers enterprise-grade, fine-grained access control that maps effectively to Monday.com's permission system.
    </p>

    <h5>Monday.com User Roles</h5>
    <p>Monday.com provides the following user roles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Full account access including user management, billing, and board creation</li>
      <li><strong>Member:</strong> Standard access to boards and workspaces</li>
      <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Read-only access to boards</li>
      <li><strong>Guest:</strong> Limited access, typically for external collaborators</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>JustDo's Multi-Layered Access Control</h5>
    <p>JustDo provides a more granular and flexible access control system with three levels:</p>

    <h6>1. Organization-Level Access</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organization Admins:</strong> Manage organization settings, invite members, and create JustDos</li>
      <li><strong>Organization Members:</strong> Able to be added as JustDo members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>2. Workspace-Level Access (JustDo Members)</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>JustDo Admins:</strong> Enable/disable plugins, control access to JustDo, update the name of JustDo</li>
      <li><strong>JustDo Members:</strong> Standard access to view and edit the tasks within the JustDo</li>
      <li><strong>JustDo Guests:</strong> Limited access to the JustDo</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>3. Task-Level Access (Task members, applicable also to Projects Collection and Projects)</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task Owner:</strong> The primary person responsible for the task</li>
      <li><strong>Task Members:</strong> Users assigned to specific tasks</li>
      <li>Individual permissions can be configured per task or field</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Access Control Migration Strategy</h5>
    <p>Here's how to map Monday.com roles to JustDo:</p>

    <table class="mapping-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Monday.com Role</th>
          <th>JustDo Equivalent</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Account Admin</td>
          <td>Organization Admin</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Workspace Admin</td>
          <td>JustDo Admin</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Board Admin</td>
          <td>Projects Collection Owner</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Member</td>
          <td>JustDo/Task member</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Viewer/Guest</td>
          <td>JustDo Guest</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h5>Permission Configuration</h5>
    <p>JustDo's permission system allows you to configure access based on conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>All:</strong> Open access to all board members</li>
      <li><strong>JustDo Admin:</strong> Only board administrators</li>
      <li><strong>JustDo Member:</strong> All board members and administrators</li>
      <li><strong>JustDo Guest:</strong> Guests, members, and administrators</li>
      <li><strong>Task Owner:</strong> Only the task owner</li>
      <li><strong>Task Member:</strong> All task members (including owner)</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Users:</strong> Specific user list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This granular control ensures that sensitive data remains secure while enabling collaboration.</p>

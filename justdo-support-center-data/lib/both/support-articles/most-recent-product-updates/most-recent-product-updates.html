  <p><strong>Archiving</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are new projects and new activities you need to work on, you need to put the old ones aside and focus on the new ones. Now you can archive those projects and tasks, removing them from your day to day view, while still having the ability to access them as needed and even unarchive. </span></p>

  <p><strong>Multi-select option custom field</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the “Options” custom field you now have the “Multi Options” type. This option allows you to create a list of predefined options from which users can select multiple values per each individual task. <img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/multi_select.jpg"}}" alt="multi_select.jpg" width="484" height="273"></span></p>

    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predecessor IDs are not clickable so you can jump to the corresponding task easily</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When copying a task you can now define the destination as well as the fields to be copied</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can now remove yourself from the members of a task (as long as you do not own a sub-task)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Streamlining User invitation</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can now invite multiple users together to the JustDo and add them as members to specific root tasks or projects immediately. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/bulk_add.png"}}" alt="bulk_add.png" width="450" height="450"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/bulk_add_2.jpg"}}" alt="bulk_add_2.jpg" width="449" height="452"></span></p>

  <p><strong>Slack times</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you need to reschedule activities, knowing how much wiggle room you have is key. Slack functionality provides you with exactly that (disabled by default). For more information click </span><a href="https://support.justdo.com/hc/en-us/articles/5913329778076-How-to-use-the-Slack-functionality-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Adding Buffers to Your Project Plan</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things usually don’t progress exactly the way they were planned. Work gets delayed or takes longer than expected. A great way to cope with this uncertainty is to include buffers into your project plan.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can add buffers that will represent extra duration that you allow activities to consume without delaying the overall timeline. The buffer’s duration automatically decreases as tasks get delayed and increases if the milestone is pushed further.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/buffer.jpg"}}" alt="buffer.jpg"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Updating the End Date when Done</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a task gets completed ahead of time. Now when you change the task’s state to done if the end date is in the future you can choose to update it using the snack bar.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/done_end_date.gif"}}" alt="done_end_date.gif" width="529" height="204"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Use Any Dependency Type You Need</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you build your task and project structure, some tasks, groups of tasks or even projects may be interdependent. In JustDo you can easily map these dependencies at any level of hierarchy and with any level of complexity that you require. Finish-to-Start dependency is the default dependency in JustDo, yet now you can also use all other dependency types: Finish-to-Finish, Start-to-Start, and Start-to-Finish.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/89CD49C2-6B9A-4557-B503-F8896544B735.GIF"}}" alt="89CD49C2-6B9A-4557-B503-F8896544B735.GIF"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Meeting Indications</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking meeting notes within JustDo keeps your team on the same page all the time and makes sure that no action items fall between the cracks.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can know if a specific task has relevant meeting notes by an indication on the tab in the task pane and by an indication on the grid.</span></p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/meeting_indications.jpg"}}" alt="meeting_indications.jpg" width="534" height="255"></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
  <p><strong>Yay! I completed a task </strong></p>
  <p>Completing a task is is a big thing!</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when you mark a task as done JustDo will celebrate it with you, playing a little animation.</span></p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/FF2938DD-0A52-468F-85D5-232ECD9701C4.GIF"}}" alt="FF2938DD-0A52-468F-85D5-232ECD9701C4.GIF" width="419" height="282"></p>
  <p><strong>Saving and Sharing Grid Views</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the strongest advantages of JustDo is flexibility, users have a broad range of control over the Grid, with the ability to customize the grid view to fit their needs for the best efficiency.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with Grid Views, users can save personal views of their customized grid, and Admins can save and share their personal view with all users of the specific JustDo.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grid Views support customizing and saving of the following: columns, width of columns, order of columns, and filters.</span></p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-05-18_23-01-15_Grid_View_1.gif"}}" alt="2022-05-18_23-01-15_Grid_View_1.gif"></p>
  <p><strong>Gantt Scroll</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantt view is an easy way to plan and manage different projects in a pictorial view. In order for users to see a selected task on the Gantt chart, they had to scroll left and right to find the task’s bar.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with the Gantt Scroll, you can jump on the Gantt timeline to find the selected task with only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one click</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can always jump to the current date on the Gantt timeline as well.</span></p>
  <p><strong><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-04-13_9-09-52_Gantt_Scroll.gif"}}" alt="2022-04-13_9-09-52_Gantt_Scroll.gif"></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Serial Dependencies</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, you have a list of tasks, each dependent on the one just before it. Instead of defining each of these dependencies manually, you can now take advantage of the “Serial dependencies” functionality, which will set all of these dependencies with only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one click</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="font-weight: bolder;" src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-04-13_9-05-33_great_things_serial_dependencies.gif"}}" alt="2022-04-13_9-05-33_great_things_serial_dependencies.gif"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Quick Notes</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times have you found yourself going back and forth between two platforms to only add a quick note or to edit your to-do list?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never again, now with Quick Notes, you can access your note list from any place in JustDo, with only one click. With Quick Notes, you can draft notes, mark them as completed, and rearrange them.</span></p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-03-20_16-35-23_Quick_notes.gif"}}" alt="2022-03-20_16-35-23_Quick_notes.gif" width="328" height="330"></span></span></p>
  <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a task from Quick Notes<br></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of the Quick Notes to create a task from your notes and add it to the relevant level in the project with a smooth drag and drop.</span></p>
  <p><strong><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-03-20_16-35-23_Quick_notes_convert_note_to_task.gif"}}" alt="2022-03-20_16-35-23_Quick_notes_convert_note_to_task.gif"></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Group Actions</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often do you make the same action on tasks one by one, over and over again?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s over, with Group Actions, you can delete, indent, outdent, move down, and move up a group of tasks at the same level at once, with just one click.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use click and SHIFT+click to select consecutive tasks, and to select non-consecutive tasks (supported for task removal) use click and CTRL+click. Available actions for the selected group are enabled on the toolbar.</span></p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2022-02-23_17-17-30_group_actions_cropped.gif"}}" alt="2022-02-23_17-17-30_group_actions_cropped.gif"></p>
  <p><strong>Parent Task’s %Complete Auto Calculation</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The %Complete of a parent task can be entered manually, and now can also be auto-calculated based on its child tasks. It is calculated automatically based on the weighted average of its subtasks. JustDo multiplies the duration of the subtasks with their %Complete values and divides the sum of them with the sum of durations.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No duration is considered as 1 day, and empty %Complete as 0%.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Task's State and %Complete Automation</strong></p>
  <p>Tasks' progress can be updated and tracked in multiple ways in JustDo including State and %Complete fields. Now <span style="font-weight: 400;">task’s State will be changed automatically to “Done” - if %Complete is set to 100%, and it will be changed automatically to “In Progress'' - if %Complete is set to 1-99%.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Status Indicator</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on the tasks that need your attention is essential in project management. In JustDo, project managers can monitor the project progress against the original project plan.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status Indicator is a new column added to the Grid as part of the Project Health extension.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The values in the Status Indicator column are determined based on the actual progress of the task against the plan:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <em>Delayed</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: if task State is “Pending” (the task hasn't started yet) and the start date has passed.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: if task State is “In Progress”, but according to the %Complete value it’s falling behind.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">Late</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: if task State is “Pending” or “In Progress” and according to its end date it should have ended by now</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overdue</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: task’s Due Date is today or passed and the task’s State is not Done</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Critical</em> Path</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the task is part of a Critical Path chain</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Task</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the task is set manually by the user as “Key Task”</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
      <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Owner</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the task owner is deactivated</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can filter tasks according to their Status Indicator values.</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/mceclip0.png"}}" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
  <p><strong>Key Task</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In project planning there are some tasks that project managers consider important, now in JustDo, users can set a specific task as a Key Task, by right-clicking on the task and selecting “Set as a Key Task” from the list. Those tasks will have a “Key Task” value in their Status Indicator column.</span></p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/mceclip1.png"}}" alt="mceclip1.png"></p>
  <p><strong>Task Types</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types is a new column added to the Grid, indicating the type of the task. Task Type could be Project or Milestone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can filter tasks according to their Types.</span></p>
  <p><strong>“My Changes” in Activity Tab</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An option to view the user’s own activity in the “Activity” tab of the bottom pane is now available. </span></p>
  <p><strong>%Complete Automations</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The %Complete of a parent task can be entered manually, and now can also be auto-calculated as the weighted average of its child tasks. In addition, task’s State is affected now by %Complete value when you update it manually. Task’s State will be changed to “Done” - if %Complete is set to 100% and to “In Progress'' - if %Complete is set to 1-99%</span></p>
  <p><strong>Status Indicator Column</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for you to focus on the tasks that really need your attention, you can now see any issues of the actual progress of the task against the plan in the new Status Indicator column. If the task is part of the critical path or if you marked it manually as a key task, it will also be indicated.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/status_indicator.png"}}" alt="status_indicator.png"></span></p>
  <p><strong><u>Undo in the Activity Tab</u></strong></p>
  <p>Sometimes when you’re working on a project, you need to revert your changes easily and safely, now you can undo your new changes to an individual task using the undo button  in the Activity tab of the Task Pane.<br>You can undo changes on each field of an individual task separately, without considering the order of changes of different fields.</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/undo.jpg"}}" alt="undo.jpg" width="254" height="203"></p>
  <p><strong><u>Seamless Basket Experience</u></strong></p>
  <p>When a task has sub-tasks, you can now see the auto-calculated values based on its child tasks in the Start/End Date and Duration columns, you can still fill the dates and duration manually as well. You can take advantage of the auto/manual value combination, for example for your top-down planning.<br>A gray rectangle at the top right of the field indicates that the value is auto-calculated based on the child’s tasks. A black rectangle indicates that both sets of values exist. The value in the field is the manually entered one, while the basket value is shown in the tooltip.</p>
  <p>If the basket start date is earlier than the task's start date or the basket end date is later than the task's end date a warning is shown on the Gantt as well as in the project health tab.</p>
  <p>Please note: this new enhancement is part of the Gantt extension.</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/2021-11-08_15-22-38_3_.gif"}}" alt="2021-11-08_15-22-38_3_.gif"></p>
  <p><strong>My Favorites View</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The projects and items that require your special attention change from time to time. With JustDo’s “My Favorites” view you can focus on the most important items that are relevant for you at this point in time. Simply mark them as favorites and use the new favorites view. Note that a little star marks these items as favorites.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/favorites__2_.GIF"}}" alt="favorites__2_.GIF" width="271" height="255"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Risk Management</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying risks ahead of time, planning for them and dealing with them when they are triggered is crucial in ensuring project’s success. You can now do all that with JustDo’s Risk management module. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/risk.png"}}" alt="risk.png"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Task Dependencies Tab</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating a task’s schedule is easy. Yet - you need to be aware of the bigger picture: its predecessors, its successors, are these part of a critical path etc. This is being reflected in the Gannt chart and now you can also see this in the new Dependencies tab of the Task Pane. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/Snag_1574d44e.png"}}" alt="Snag_1574d44e.png"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Workload Percentage Allocation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important tasks as a project manager is to monitor the workload of your users. In the calendar view you can see the workload percentage for each and every employee. This is now calculated based on the hours planned for each task or the workload percentage allocation. For each task you can define the percentage of the work day that the owner would invest in, the system would alert you if there is a conflict between the two. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/Snag_1574b647.png"}}" alt="Snag_1574b647.png"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Chat Minimization</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JustDo’s smart chat is a very powerful tool for your day to day communication, hence you may be engaged in multiple chats in parallel. You now can easily minimize these chats and quickly get back to them when needed.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/0DB83A2B-917A-4536-82BA-3EF189662E8C.GIF"}}" alt="0DB83A2B-917A-4536-82BA-3EF189662E8C.GIF" width="359" height="408"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Tracking Progress Against a Baseline</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very useful to compare your project progress to a saved baseline in order to track changes. Now when selecting a baseline to be displayed, you can add to the grid not only the baseline start and end date but also duration and the differences between the task current start and end dates and its duration to the ones saved in the baseline.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/baseline_deltas.jpg"}}" alt="baseline_deltas.jpg" width="659" height="275"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Fresh New Look</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that not everybody likes to view the platform in the same way. Therefore, we have just added five additional new themes. The default theme is now “Solid Dark Blue” unless you have specifically selected another theme. As always, the theme can be changed in your “Account Preferences”.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/theme_changing.gif"}}" alt="theme_changing.gif" width="642" height="401"> </span></p>
  <p><strong>Project Health Tab</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with a complex project portfolio, you need to quickly identify the tasks that need your attention. Now, when you enable the new “Projects’ Health” extension you will easily see a list of all tasks that are falling behind or have an alert associated with them.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/Project_health.png"}}" alt="Project_health.png" width="629" height="357"></span></p>
  <p><strong>Freeze Subject Column</strong></p>
  <p>JustDo allows you to customize your Grid view and add as many columns as you need and want to see. One of these columns can even be a complete Gantt chart. When you scroll right and don't want to lose context you can now freeze the subject column so it always shows up.</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/freeze_subject.GIF"}}" alt="freeze_subject.GIF" width="624" height="278"></p>
  <p><strong>Enhanced Importing Capabilities</strong></p>
  <p>If you already have tasks or project plans in another platform you do not need to create them all from scratch. You can easily import the task structure from a spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>With the enhanced Importing tool, you can easily import systems as well as custom fields and now also the state of each of the tasks and even the inter-task dependencies. This assures a swift and flawless import. An unsupported dependency will show up in red in the predecessor column.</p>
  <p><img src="{{getCDNUrl "/packages/justdoinc_justdo-support-center-data/lib/both/support-articles/most-recent-product-updates/assets/import_dependencies1.gif"}}" alt="import_dependencies1.gif"></p>
  <p><strong>Support Lags and Leads</strong></p>

  <p dir="ltr">JustDo’s <em>Resource Management</em> is a complementary extension that lets you:<br><br></p>
  <ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
    <strong>When planning a project, estimate the labor and budget required.</strong>  Map the time that each team member has to contribute in order to complete any specific task, and see how it accumulates over different tasks that are higher in the project’s tasks-tree. </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Know how many hours and how much money were actually spent on any given project or task.</strong> Team members can easily log the time and money they spent on any task while they are working on it. This information is collected, aggregated, and presented in a way that shows the total and breakdown of the hours and money spent. You can see each of your team members' and overall contributions.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>Know how close you are to completing any project or task.</strong> Once you know how many hours are needed to accomplish your goals and how many hours were already spent, a good estimation is available, showing how much of the project has been completed and how much more is left to do. </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Update and </strong><strong>fine-tune</strong><strong> your plans over time. </strong>As you understand the project better and adjust the resource estimation to accommodate real-life demands, changes, updates and other events, you can update the amounts planned for every task. The system will immediately reflect those changes and will show how they affect the amounts left to do in order to complete the project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong><br>JustDo is highly configurable. Mold it to your needs! JustDo allows you to pick and choose the tools that are important to you. Depending on the project, you might only use the Resource Management Module to understand the resource requirements. In another situation, you may only care to know how much was spent on each task. Sometimes both data sets or neither may be valuable. Feel free to pick the appropriate tools for your project, out of the set that we provide.</p>

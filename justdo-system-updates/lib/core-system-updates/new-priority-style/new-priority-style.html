  <p>Following our update email, we introduced a change to the way that JustDo displays tasksâ€™ priorities.</p>

  <p>Previously, tasks priorities were marked by setting the background color of the entire task line. The 'redder' the background color, the higher the task's priority.
  In this version, tasks' priorities are marked with a priority indicator at the beginning of the line as seen below.</p>

  <div style="background-image: url(https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/justdo-media-files/web-app/new-priority.gif); background-size: cover;  height: 220px; margin-bottom: 17px;"></div>



  <p>We had a long internal debate if to make this change, and eventually decided to do so for the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It makes the selected task easier to recognize</li>
    <li>It allows us to highlight all the tasks that come up in a search</li>
    <li>It is future compatible with the (coming soon) multi-task selection and updates</li>
    <li>It matches our style and design of the mobile app</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused by getting used to this new look, but we are sure that this is a necessary step in the right direction.</p>

  <p>As always, we love hearing your feedback and gaining your insights as your engagement and comments help shape JustDo.</p>

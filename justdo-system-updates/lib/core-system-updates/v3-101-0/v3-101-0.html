<h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Fresh New Look</h5>
<p>We know that not everybody likes to view the platform in the same way. Therefore, we have just added five additional new themes. The default theme is now “Solid Dark Blue” unless you have specifically selected another theme. As always, the theme can be changed in your “Account Preferences”.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Project Health Tab</h5>
<p>When dealing with a complex project portfolio, you need to quickly identify the tasks that need your attention. Now, when you enable the new “Projects’ Health” extension you will easily see a list of all tasks that are falling behind or have an alert associated with them.</p>

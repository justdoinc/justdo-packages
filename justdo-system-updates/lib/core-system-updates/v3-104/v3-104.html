<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Workload Percentage Allocation</h5>
<p>One of the most important tasks as a project manager is to monitor the workload of your users. In the calendar view you can see the workload percentage for each and every employee. This is now calculated based on the hours planned for each task or the workload percentage allocation. For each task you can define the percentage of the work day that the owner would invest in, the system would alert you if there is a conflict between the two.</p>

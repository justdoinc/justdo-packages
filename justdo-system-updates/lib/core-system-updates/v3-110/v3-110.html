  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Undo in the Activity Tab</h5>
  <p>Sometimes when youâ€™re working on a project, you need to revert your changes easily and safely, now you can undo your new changes to an individual task using the undo button  in the Activity tab of the Task Pane.</p>
  <p>You can undo changes on each field of an individual task separately, without considering the order of changes of different fields.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Seamless Basket Experience</h5>
  <p>When a task has sub-tasks, you can now see the auto-calculated values based on its child tasks in the Start/End Date and Duration columns, you can still fill the dates and duration manually as well. You can take advantage of the auto/manual value combination, for example for your top-down planning.</p>
  <p>A gray rectangle at the top right of the field indicates that the value is auto-calculated based on the child tasks. A black rectangle indicates that both sets of values exist. The value in the field is the manually entered one, while the basket value is shown in the tooltip.
  If the basket start date is earlier than the task's start date or the basket end date is later than the task's end date a warning is shown on the Gantt as well as in the project health tab.</p>
  <p>Please note: this new enhancement is part of the Gantt extension.</p>

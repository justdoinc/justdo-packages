  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">% Complete Automations</h5>
  <p>The %Complete of a parent task can be entered manually, and now can also be auto-calculated as the weighted average of its child tasks. In addition, task’s State is affected now by %Complete value when you update it manually. Task’s State will be changed to “Done” - if %Complete is set to 100% and to “In Progress'' - if %Complete is set to 1-99%.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Status Indicator Column</h5>
  <p>In order for you to focus on the tasks that really need your attention, you can now see any issues of the actual progress of the task against the plan in the new Status Indicator column. If the task is part of the critical path or if you marked it manually as a key task, it will also be indicated.</p>

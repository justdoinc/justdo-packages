  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Group Actions</h5>
  <p>How often do you make the same action on tasks one by one, over and over again?<br>

Now itâ€™s over, with Group Actions, you can delete, indent, outdent, move down, and move up a group of tasks at the same level at once, with just one click.<br>

Use click and SHIFT+click to select consecutive tasks, and to select non-consecutive tasks (supported for task removal) use click and CTRL+click. Available actions for the selected group are enabled on the toolbar.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Gantt Scroll</h5>
  <p>Gantt view is an easy way to plan and manage different projects in a pictorial view. In order for users to see a selected task on the Gantt chart, they had to scroll left and right to find the task’s bar.<br>
    Now with the Gantt Scroll, you can jump on the Gantt timeline to find the selected task with only one click. You can always jump to the current date on the Gantt timeline as well.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Serial Dependencies</h5>
  <p>In many cases, you have a list of tasks, each dependent on the one just before it. Instead of defining each of these dependencies manually, you can now take advantage of the “Serial dependencies” functionality, which will set all of these dependencies with only one click.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Meeting Indications</h5>
  <p>Tracking meeting notes within JustDo keeps your team on the same page all the time and makes sure that no action items fall between the cracks.<br>
    Now you can know if a specific task has relevant meeting notes by an indication on the tab in the task pane and by an indication on the grid.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Yay! I completed a task</h5>
  <p>Research shows that people are more engaged and willing to update status of tasks and projects when they get "rewarded" for completing tasks.<br>
Now when you mark a task as Done a little animation will be played.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Use Any Dependency Type You Need</h5>
  <p>When you build your task and project structure, some tasks, groups of tasks or even projects may be interdependent. In JustDo you can easily map these dependencies at any level of hierarchy and with any level of complexity that you require. Finish-to-Start dependency is the default dependency in JustDo, yet now you can also use all other dependency types: Finish-to-Finish, Start-to-Start, and Start-to-Finish.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Buffers and Slack time</h5>
  <p>Things usually don’t progress exactly the way they were planned. Work gets delayed or takes longer than expected. A great way to cope with this uncertainty is to include buffers into your project plan.
Now you can add buffers that will represent extra duration that you allow activities to consume without delaying the overall timeline. The buffer’s duration automatically decreases as tasks get delayed and increases if the milestone is pushed further.

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Updating the End Date when Done</h5>
  <p>Sometimes a task gets completed ahead of time. Now when you change the task’s state to done if the end date is in the future you can choose to update it using the snack bar.</p>

  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Archiving</h5>
  <p>When there are new projects and new activities you need to work on, you need to put the old ones aside and focus on the new ones. Now you can archive those projects and tasks, removing them from your day to day view, while still having the ability to access them as needed and even unarchive.</p>

  <p>In addition to the “Options” custom field you now have the “Multi Options” type. This option allows you to create a list of predefined options from which users can select multiple values per each individual task.</p>

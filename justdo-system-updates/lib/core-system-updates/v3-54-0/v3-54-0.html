  <h4 class="mt-2 mb-4 font-weight-bold">We Have Great New Things for You</h4>
  <p>The Context Menu has multiple new options and double-clicking a cell will let you edit a value.
Also, if your team members need to report time spent on each of the tasks, you are probably
using the Time Tracker plug-in. We have enhanced it with more useful functions.</p>
<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-2">Double-click to start edit</h5>
<p>You can now click on a line and still use the Context Menu (right button) and the indications
icons. If you would like to edit the value simply double click it.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-2">Improved “Context Menu”</h5>
<p>Right clicking on a task (or using the three dots icon on the task row) will allow you to set/unset
the task as a project, assign the task to an additional project (the task would appear under the
project root) and remove the task completely.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-2">Time Tracker enhancements</h5>
<p>Best is if your team members remember to record the time spent on each task as it happens.
Yet, in many cases you need the option to report time spent for others or in retrospective. This is
now possible through the enhanced capabilities of the Time Tracker plug-in – each member can
report their time spent in retrospective and admins can even do that for others along with the
ability to filter by member.
New filtering option by time period was added, time now includes seconds as well and the time
tracking report is easily accessible from within this tab.</p>

<p>JustDo allows you to customize your Grid view and add as many columns as you need and want to see. One of these columns can even be a complete Gantt chart. When you scroll right and don't want to lose context you can now freeze the subject column so it always shows up.</p>

<p>Sometimes a task can only start a few days after another task ends, in other cases a task can start a few days before another task ends. Now you can easily define this using the predecessor column and the project structure as well as the critical path calculations will immediately reflect that.</p>
